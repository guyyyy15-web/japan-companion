description: Hebrew/English bilingual UI rules for Japan Companion — the i18n dictionaries (he.ts / en.ts), direction switching, CSS logical properties, isolating Japanese and numbers inside Hebrew text, currency formatting, and Hebrew UI copy tone. Use when adding any user-visible string, building or styling a component, or fixing text that shows up reversed, misaligned or untranslated. For deeper RTL issues also load the hebrew-rtl-forge skill if available.

# Hebrew / English UI

## Strings

- Every UI string goes through `t('key')`. No literal text in components.
- Dictionaries: `app/src/i18n/en.ts` is the source of truth for keys, and
  `he.ts` must have **exactly** the same keys. `i18n.test.ts` fails
  otherwise.
- Content text (phrases, signs) is **not** in the dictionaries. It carries
  its own `he` / `en` fields.
- Language choice is stored in `localStorage` (`jc.lang`). The first
  launch defaults to Hebrew.

## Direction

- The `setLang()` helper sets `<html lang dir>`: `he` → `rtl`, `en` → `ltr`.
- CSS uses **logical properties only**: `margin-inline-start`,
  `padding-inline`, `inset-inline-end`, `text-align: start`. Never
  `left`/`right` for layout.
- Icons that mean direction (back arrow, chevron) flip in RTL. Icons that
  don't (🔊, ★, ¥) never flip.
- Japanese is always wrapped: `<span lang="ja" dir="ltr">…</span>`
  (the `<Ja>` component). This gives the right font and keeps the order.
- Amounts: wrap in `<bdi>` (the `<MoneyText>` component), so an amount
  never gets split or reordered inside a Hebrew sentence. `he-IL` puts the
  symbol after the number ("‏96.00 ₪"). That's correct Hebrew style; don't
  "fix" it.

## Numbers and currency

- Use `Intl.NumberFormat` via `formatMoney(amount, currency, lang)`:
  - JPY: 0 decimals.
  - ILS/USD: 2 decimals under 100, 0 decimals at 100 and above.
- Keep Western digits in both languages. That's normal in Israel.

## Hebrew copy tone

- Address **plural / gender-neutral**. The app speaks to a couple:
  imperatives in plural ("הקישו", "בחרו") or noun form ("המרה", "הגדרות").
  Avoid singular masculine ("הקש").
- Short and warm, the way a friend who knows Japan would say it. No
  bureaucratic Hebrew.
- Japanese terms keep their common Israeli spelling: סואיקה, קונביני,
  אונסן, ין.

## Small screens

Design for a 375px-wide iPhone first. Never put choices the user must see in a
sideways-scrolling row. Use a grid or wrapping chips instead (sideways rows
are fine only for "recent" history). Keep option text around 0.85rem and
touch targets at least 36–44px tall. Anything sticky at the bottom
(result cards) stays under about a third of the screen.
